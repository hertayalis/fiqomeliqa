The state’s position far inland and its distance from large bodies of water result in a usually dry climate. While there are hot summers and cold winters, the temperature differences can be significant throughout the day.</p><h3>Is Colorado colder than Chicago?</h3><p>Denver, Colorado is slightly cooler than Chicago, Illinois.
