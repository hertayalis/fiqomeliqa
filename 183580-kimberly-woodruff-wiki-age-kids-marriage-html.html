wife is known for keeping the personal aspects of her life private, so information about her background is not available online.</p><p class=Fg>The rapper, however, has shared some details of his relationship with Kimberly, including <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdbtI-YAqy4&feature=youtu.be">his reaction</a> when he saw her for the first time:</p><p class=Fg>“The first time I saw her, the first thing that went through my head was, ‘Wow, that could be your woman.’ That was the first thought in my head, and I didn’t know her.”</p><p class=Fg>Although Ice Cube’s intentions with Kimberly were clear, she didn’t pay him attention. In his own words, his now-wife was “not having” or “digging” him as she “probably was in a relationship.”</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Kimberly and Ice Cube’s relationship</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Fortunately for the rapper, destiny arranged a second meeting about six months after their first encounter. That time, the situation was completely different as he even got her number.</p><p class=Fg>Joking about that second chance that life gave him, Ice Cube said that Kimberly Woodruff could catch his “flavor,” and she ended up falling in love with him.</p><p class=Fg>In 1988, they started dating. Only three years later, the couple got engaged, and on April 26, 1992, Ice Cube and Kimberly Woodruff tied the knot. Since they are still married nowadays, their “till death do us part” seems to be unquestionable.</p><p class=Fg>During a 2014 interview, the rapper described their relationship as a partnership because they respect each other. Ice Cube also <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdbtI-YAqy4&feature=youtu.be">pointed out</a> that the butterflies were still “definitely” present.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Their romance from the eyes of Alexandra Shipp</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Kimberly is indeed an extraordinary person as even Alexandra Shipp, the young actress who portrayed Ice Cube’s wife on “Straight Outta Compton,” said so.</p><p class=Fg>In an interview with Hip Hollywood, Alexandra <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYjmWKGVXQQ&feature=youtu.be">confessed</a> that, as a way to prepare for her role, she met Kimberly and labeled her as “the dopest woman ever.” The young actress said that Kim and Ice Cube were each other’s cheerleaders, business partners, and best friends.</p><p class=Fg>During their time together, Ice Cube and Kimberly have had five children: sons O'Shea Jr. who followed in his father’s footsteps and became a rapper and an actor, Darrell, and Shareef Jackson, and daughters Kareema and Deja Jackson.</p><p class=Fg>Apart from building a beautiful family and having an excellent relationship, Kim and her rapper husband have amassed a lot of money. Ice Cube’s net worth is estimated at $160 million according to <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://wealthygorilla.com/ice-cube-net-worth/>Wealthygorilla.com</a>.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Ice Cube’s net worth</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>His wealth is the result of several years working hard not only in the music industry but also in the filming one. Some of the <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hiphopgoldenage.com/list/top-15-ice-cube-songs/>most popular</a> Ice Cube songs are “Hello,” in collaboration with Dr. Dre and MC Ren, “Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It,” “Dead Homiez,” and “It Was a Good Day.”</p><p class=Fg>If being a talented and respected rapper was not hard enough, O'Shea Jackson is also a renowned actor with plenty of acting credits.</p><p class=Fg>Among the most famous Ice Cube’s <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls064909896/>movies</a>, there are: “21 Jump Street,” “Anaconda,” “Are We There Yet?” “Fist Fight,” and of course, one of the films that put him on the map, “Boyz ‘N the Hood.”</p><p class=Fg>Even though being the son of such a celebrity seems great, O’Shea Jackson Jr. once opened up about the difficulties of being Ice Cube’s son.</p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=#>O’Shea Jr.</a> admitted that the “Junior” was a “gift and a course” due to all the pressure that a child could feel for bearing his father’s name.</p><p class=Fg>He pointed out, though, that “pressure makes diamonds,” so people should not be scared of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpvbG1oZXqstcybnKukqWLEsLvDq6yfnl2stqy1jJqenmWbnrG0ecyaqauhkZyyb7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./olivia-rothe-net-worth-314935.html>&#171;&nbsp;Olivia Rothe Net Worth 2024</a>
